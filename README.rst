Overview
========

Sturgeon is a double project. The excuse is to make a program about some simple aspects of population dynamics.

For me (Nicolás) is actually an opportunity to teach programming and python to a scientists and learn some science in the meantime.

With a little bit of luck for Ivan is an opportunity to learn some programming and programming techniques.

If there is a real program in the end, the better.
